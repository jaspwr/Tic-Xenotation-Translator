## Teacher of the Tic Matrix
65 million BC.
The K/T-Missile, Pregnant with the Entity, slants in. 16 clicks per second. Professor Barker recalls
this moment catching the trajectory. He coaxes it across the Cataplex-map, through intricate
cartographic dances, snakings, twistings. Scars and vectors slot-together. It sticks. Irridium stink of
the Entity so strong it hisses. Tick iterations. Ticks, scratches, chitterings silt across the Outside.
Barker senses its passage stroke him, nerve-tense as the distant twin, weaving through tatters of
cored-out schizophrenia, in the habitation blister.

Tick-delirium.

Daniel C . Barker's Tic Xenotation emerged during the
highly obscure phase of his life when he was working
for ' NASA ' (some hesitation is appropriate here) on the
SETI -related ' Project Scar' in Southeast Asia, tasked with
designing a 'general purpose decryption protocol' for
identifying intelligent signal from alien sources .
This project necessitated the formulation of numeric
conventions independent of all cultural conditioning or
local convention - radically abstract signs.
